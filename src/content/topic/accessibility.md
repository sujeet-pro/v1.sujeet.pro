Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops standards and support materials to help you understand and implement accessibility.

W3C-WAI has published technology-agnostic criteria for accessibility conformance known as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG)) under the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

## Four Principles of WCAG

* [Perceivable:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable) Users must be able to perceive it in some way, using one or more of their senses.
* [Operable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Operable): Users must be able to control UI elements (e.g. buttons must be clickable in some way — mouse, keyboard, voice command, etc.).
* [Understandable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Understandable): The content must be understandable to its users.
* [Robust](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Robust): The content must be developed using well-adopted web standards that will work across different browsers, now and in the future.
